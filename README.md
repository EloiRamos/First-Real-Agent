- **Average Response Time** - Mean response time in seconds

### Logging

All agent activities are logged to `agent_logs.log`:

```
2024-01-15 10:30:45,123 - INFO - Query received: Where is my order #12345?...
2024-01-15 10:30:46,234 - INFO - Query resolved in 1.11s

# Check agent health
import logging
from first_real_agent import monitored_agent

# View recent logs
with open('agent_logs.log', 'r') as f:
    recent_logs = f.readlines()[-10:]

# Get current metrics
metrics = monitored_agent.get_metrics()
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. OpenAI API Errors
**Error:** `AuthenticationError: Invalid API key`
**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify API key in .env file
echo $OPENAI_API_KEY

# Test API key validity
python -c "import openai; print('API key valid')"
```

#### 2. Database Connection Issues
**Error:** `sqlite3.OperationalError: no such table`
**Solution:**
```bash
# Initialize databases
python -c "import sqlite3; conn = sqlite3.connect('orders.db'); conn.execute('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS orders (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY)'); conn.commit()"
```

#### 3. Import Errors
**Error:** `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'langchain'`
**Solution:**
```bash
# Install missing dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Update pip
pip install --upgrade pip
```

#### 4. Performance Issues
**Error:** Slow response times
**Solution:**
- Reduce `max_iterations` in agent configuration
- Lower `temperature` setting for faster, more consistent responses
- Check system resources and memory usage

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging for detailed troubleshooting:

```python
import logging

# Enable debug logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

# Run agent with debug output
response = monitored_agent.run("test query")
```
